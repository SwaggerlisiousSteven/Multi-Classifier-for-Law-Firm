    "print(dtc_clf.predict(count_vect.transform([\"AT the outset I should like to point out that if this man was guilty of receiving a stolen cow, then a fine of Rs. 200/- was quite inadequate. Life in,villages in Bengal and elsewhere would become quite impossible if theft of cattle and the crime of receiving stolen cattle were dealt with leniently. Stealing a villager's cow is a very serious offence, and so is, being in possession of such a cow knowing it to be stolen. But for the view I take on the question of guilt, I should have no hesitation in issuing a notice to enhance this sentence. THE case for the prosecution was that the cow in question belonged to the complainant Harimati Dasi. The cow was found to be missing about the end of February 1948 and on March 12, 1948 the complainant reported the matter to the Ekbalpore Police. About two months after she had given the Police information, her missing cow, it was said, was found in the possession of one Fouzdar Sardar. The complainant then filed a petition of complaint against Fouzdar Sardar and the cow was seized under a search warrant issued by a learned Magistrate against Fouzdar Sardar. Whilst the case was pending, Fouzdar Sardar died and the person who was holding the cow was directed to make it over to the complainant. But he refused to do it and the cow was again seized under a search warrant.THE present petitioner Bharadwaj then filed a petition in the court of the Police Magistrate at Alipore claiming this cow as his own and stating that Fouzdar Sardar had been looking after the cow on his behalf. The petitioner claimed the cow and notice was issued upon the complainant who promptly retaliated by praying for process against Bharadwaj under   Section 411, I. P. C.EVIDENCE was adduced before the learned Magistrate that the complainant's cow had strayed and that the cow eventually found in possession of Fouzdar Sardar was the complainant's cow. This evidence was hotly contested by the defence. But I shall assume that it was proved satisfactorily that the cow in the possession of Fouzdar Sardar was the cow which has strayed from the complainant's premises about two or three months earlier.IT was argued in the lower courts that there was no evidence that this cow had been stolen. All the evidence amounts to is that it disappeared and of course it may have strayed. Taking possession however of a straying cow knowing it to be an animal which has strayed might well amount to theft, and I shall assume that this cow was stolen from the complainant by someone. BEING in possession of stolen property is in itself no offence. If it was, all of us I imagine would be in serious danger constantly. Any one in this Court might buy an article today quite openly and honestly and later find that that article had been stolen. If being in possession of stolen property was itself a crime, then an innocent purchase of that sort would render the purchaser liable to conviction for a serious offence. Being in possession of stolen property is only a crime if the person in possession either knows that the property is stolen property or has reasonable grounds for believing that the property had been stolen.TO succeed in a prosecution under  Section 411 I. P. C. , the prosecution must not only prove that the property had been stolen, but they must also, establish facts from which the Court can properly infer that the person charged with, being in possession of stolen property either knew the property to be stolen, or had reasonable grounds for believing the same to have been stolen. Unless there is some prima facie evidence as.\"])))"

The appellant is the Corporation of Calcutta. The premises concerned is situated in an area which appertained formerly to what was once the Tollygunge Municipality. It appears that in the year 1951, there was a general assessment and in the course of that assessment, the respondent's property which is Premises No. 46 Izazatulla Lane was assessed to a valuation of Rs. 270/-. The Tollygunge Municipality was superseded by an order of the State of West Bengal on 26-11-1951, for the period of one year, but the period of supersession was subsequently extended from time to time. Upon superseding the Municipality, the State of West Bengal appointed one Shri Priya Nath Bose to be the Administrator and to exercise all the powers and discharge all the duties which might be done by the Chairman and the Commissioners of the Municipality, whether at a meeting or otherwise. The Administrator, upon assuming office, made special arrangements for a public exhibition of the new assessment lists and those were exhibited on 2-1-1952. The respondent who was dissatisfied with the assessment made upon his property filed an objection before the Administrator under Section 148 Bengal Municipal Act, That objection was filed on 30-1-1952 and was disposed of on 21-5-1952. The Administrator gave effect to the respondent's objection to a certain extent and reduced the valuation from Rs. 270/- to Rs. 240/-.\"])))\n",

    "print(rfc_clf.predict(count_vect.transform([\"THE plaintiff opposite party, Sadhan Chandra Barik filed a title suit, being t. S. No. 93 of 1974, in the First Court of the Munsif atDiamondHarbour against the defendant-petitioner praying for a declaration of title and for injunction in respect of the suit laid described in schedule Khas to the plaint. The defendant-petitioner entered appearance and claimed that he was a Bargadar in respect of the suit land and on april 7, 1975 filed an application before the learned Munsif for referring to the bhagchas Officer for a decision of the question whether the defendant was a bargadar or not in accordance with the provisions of  section 21 (3) of the West. Bengal Land Reforms Act , 1955 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act). The learned Munsif by order No. 26 dated june 17, 1975 rejected the petitioner's application holding, inter alia, that the dispute between the parties was the subject matter of a suit'and the order prayed for would tantamount to the passing of an interlocutory order in the suit as it would not be a proceeding and as such as in    section 21 (3) of the act the word proceeding and not 'suit' has been used he had no authority to refer the question to the Bhagchas officer. This Order of the learned munsif has been impugned in this Rule. IN my view, this application must succeed Section 21 (3) of the Act is in the following terms :- if any question as to whether a person is or is rot a bargadar arises in the course of any proceedings before any Civil or Criminal Court, the court shall refer to the officer or authority mentioned in sub-section (1) of   section 18 lord decision. IT is clear from a reading of the aforesaid sub-section that the word proceeding is wide enough to cover a suit. It this was not so, then, if a question whether a person was or was not a bargadar arose in a suit, then the authority constituted under the Act to determine this question would have no jurisdiction to do. This could not possibly be the intention of the legislature which has created a special authority under the Act to determine the aforesaid question.THIS <DP>application accordingly succeeds </DP>and the Rule is made absolute. Order No. 26 dated 17. 6. 75, passed by the learned Munsif, First Court, diamond Harbour in Title Suit No. 93/74 is set aside. The learned Munsif will refer to the appropriate authority under the Act the question whether the defendant is a bargadar or not and after getting a report of the competent authority, he will proceed with the suit in accordance with law. </HD>There will be no orders as to costs in this Rule. Rule made absoluteIN the instant case in the course of wearing of the suit a question was raised whether the defendant was a bargadar or not. The petition by the defendant to the court for a reference to the Bhagchas Officer is therefore competent and the learned Munsif should have referred the matter accordingly under section 21 (3) of the Act to the authority contemplated under the Act.\"])))"
